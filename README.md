Hello and welcome! This is the starter code for each scrim in Bob Ziroll's Learn React Router 6 course on Scrimba! ‚öõÔ∏è 

To follow the course on Scrimba's **interactive code-learning platform**, head to the [Learn React Router 6 page](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6) on Scrimba!


## Please read this carefully!
This README file is the best "single source of truth" for you to see updates made to the course if you're coming from the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel!

As time passes, dependencies can sometimes become outdated or start exhibiting bugs that weren't there when I first recorded the course.

In the version of this course on Scrimba, it's easy for me to add quick updates and new lessons. However, the course on YouTube is frozen in time and unchangeable. So please come check the "[Updates](#updates)" section below often, as you may find there are important updates that can help you avoid common bugs.


## Setup
Check out this video for a walkthrough of the steps to get your project set up on your own machine.

### Written Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your own machine
2. `cd` to the main folder in Terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. (Optional, but preferred) Open just the section folder you're currently working on (e.g. 01 - Introduction to React Router) in your editor
5. `cd` into the section folder, then into the specific lesson folder you're currently on.
6. Run `npm run dev` to spin up the dev server
7. Copy/paste or click on the localhost URL it provides to see the project at the starting point of the lesson
8. Open the relevant files from the lesson and follow along.

To kill the dev server, hit ctrl + c.

## Updates
### April 28, 2023
In "Lesson 90: Challenge - Protected Routes in VanLife Part 2" [(https://youtu.be/nDGA3km5He4?t=23735)](https://youtu.be/nDGA3km5He4?t=23735) (05 - Actions and Protected Routes/14 - Challenge - Protected Routes in VanLife - Part 2), I remove `return null` from my inline loaders which was incorrect. What I should have followed up with was to add `return null` to the end of the `requireAuth` outside of the if statement. The code at the end of this challenge should be:

```js
import { redirect } from "react-router-dom"

export async function requireAuth() {
    const isLoggedIn = false
    
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
        throw redirect("/login")
    }
    return null
}
```
This way, for the loaders that are *only* running `await requireAuth()`, at least something (well, `null`, if you can call that "something" üòÇ) will get returned if the user is logged in.

### April 21, 2023
With an update made to v 6.4.5 of React Router, Mirage JS is causing some errors when using the `redirect` function from React Router. **tl;dr:** a library that Mirage JS is using under the hood (`pretender`) uses a polyfill for `fetch`, and that polyfill does not adhere to the `fetch` specifications, in that it does not return a response with a `body` property. In React Router 6.4.5, they included a new check to make sure that a response has a `body` property, which makes any `redirect` call in React Router fail.

You can work around this issue by modifying the response that comes back when calling `redirect`, like so:

Instead of
```js
return redirect("new-url")
```

You can capture the response in a variable and add a body property manually:
```js
const response = redirect("new-url)
response.body = true  // It's silly, but it works
return response
```
